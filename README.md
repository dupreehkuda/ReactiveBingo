# ReactiveBingo
This is a bingo app created with React.js and Go in 2 days. <br>
I created this to learn how to link frontend and backend to each other to have a better understanding of procesess that can happen when building a project.

## Idea
This is not an average bingo game. This is task bingo.  

The idea is to think of 16 tasks that you would like to do everyday to increase your productivity and at the end of the day you will fill the table with task numbers you've done to see if you got any bingos.

## Start
All frontend React stuff is stored the `client` folder and the Go backend part is stored in `server`. 

1. To start the project just just go `~/ReactiveBingo/server` and run `go run main.go` so you will start the Fiber app. 

2. Then go to `~/ReactiveBingo/client` and run `yarn dev`. 

3. If done right, the app will be availiable on **localhost:3000**

## Contact
I'm currently working on myself and looking for a job as a Go developer;) I also write apps for iOS with Swift and SwiftUI.
